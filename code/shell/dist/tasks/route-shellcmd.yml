description: Write a shell command
prompt: >+
    I would like to achieve this: {prompt}.

    Evaluate the complexity of the task (integer from 1 to 10) and decide if a a simple one line command is ok or if 
    a multiline script is better to fullfill the request. The command must be clear and simple, 
    otherwise prefer a bash script for more clarity.

    Important: output in this format: {"method": "litteral 'command' or 'script'", "complexity": number}
